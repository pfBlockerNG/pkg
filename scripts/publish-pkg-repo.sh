# publish-pkg-repo.sh — verify + publish a Tagged release's or a Nightly snapshot's
# .pkg assets into the pfBlockerNG/pkg catalogue tree, then commit + fast-forward-push
# the result. Site rendering is NOT this script's job: pfBlockerNG/pkg's docs/ site
# (index.html, browse/, .nojekyll, install.sh, …) is render-pkg-site.sh's own,
# separately dispatched (issue #2450 step 2). This script owns catalogue paths
# only: docs/<stable|testing|edge|nightly>/<varver>/ and docs/staging/<segment>/.
#
# PUBLISH_KIND selects the mode (default "tagged" when unset):
#   tagged   PFB_SRC/scripts/publish_release.py verifies + assembles a tagged
#            Release's assets against the pinned ROUTE matrix.
#   nightly  PFB_SRC/scripts/publish_nightly.py verifies + assembles a verified
#            Nightly handoff's assets, fanned out to every ROUTE varver sharing
#            each build's FreeBSD major.
# Neither publisher ever runs git itself; this script owns the ONLY git mutation
# in the whole flow: syncing PKG_REPO to origin/main, staging exactly what the
# publisher reports touched, committing, and pushing.
#
# CONTAINMENT: a publisher failure — verification, or a mid-regeneration
# write-back fault inside catalogue_assembly.py — must never reach a commit. This
# script enforces that structurally: every git mutation (add/commit/push) happens
# strictly AFTER a successful publisher run, and a non-zero exit from it
# is `exit 1` on the spot, before any git add ever runs. There is no
# `git add -A` / `git add .` anywhere below — only the exact touched (channel,
# varver) directories the publisher reports. A second, independent guard runs
# right before every commit (every mode): the staged diff must touch ONLY
# docs/<stable|testing|edge|nightly|staging>/ paths — catches a hostile or buggy
# "updated <path>" report (e.g. a `..`-bearing target) that the per-target `git
# add` alone would otherwise trust blindly.
#
# On a rejected push (another run advanced origin/main first), the ENTIRE cycle
# reruns from a fresh sync — not a rebase of the local commit — because
# the publisher's retention must see the racing run's tree, not stale local
# state. checkout -B restores tracked files; `git clean -fd -- docs` drops
# untracked leftovers under docs/ (issue #2407) so a dest autoindex without its
# .pkgs cannot survive into the next attempt.
#
# PUBLISH_STAGE additionally selects WHEN a tagged catalogue commit becomes the
# live Pages site (issue #2389 — gate-before-announce). docs/ on `main` IS the
# Pages site, so a plain publish (PUBLISH_STAGE=direct, the default) commits the
# catalogue directly. The three extra values split that into a stage-then-promote
# flow:
#   stage    run the publisher exactly as "direct" does, against the real tree,
#            then relocate its output under docs/staging/<run-segment>/ instead
#            of leaving it at its real (channel, varver) location — restoring
#            the original bytes there — so a live install can be gated against
#            the staged path while nothing else on the site moves. A catalogue
#            no-op stages nothing and reports GITHUB_OUTPUT noop=true.
#   promote  move a previously staged tree (STAGING_PREFIX) into its real
#            location — this is the step that actually goes live. Never runs
#            the publisher.
#   discard  drop a previously staged tree (STAGING_PREFIX) without ever going
#            live. Never runs the publisher.
# promote/discard act on STAGING_PREFIX as staged (a prior "stage" run's own
# GITHUB_OUTPUT staging_prefix). PUBLISH_STAGE values other than "direct" are a
# usage error under PUBLISH_KIND=nightly — nightly keeps today's
# publish-then-gate flow untouched.
#
# Required environment — every mode:
#   PFB_SRC               current pkg checkout containing the local publisher/site code
#   PKG_REPO              same pkg checkout with a credentialed origin remote
#   SOURCE_RUN_ID          identifies this run to the publisher (tagged:
#                        publish_release.py intake; nightly: must equal the
#                        handoff's own run_id — see publish_nightly.py --help).
#                        PUBLISH_STAGE=stage also uses it as a staging path
#                        segment: `:` is translated to `-` (the real workflows
#                        set SOURCE_RUN_ID="<run_id>:<run_attempt>"), and it must
#                        otherwise match [0-9A-Za-z_:-]+.
# Optional — every mode:
#   PUBLISH_KIND           "tagged" (default) or "nightly"; anything else is a
#                        usage error
#   PUBLISH_STAGE           "direct" (default), "stage", "promote", or "discard";
#                        anything else is a usage error. Only "direct" is valid
#                        when PUBLISH_KIND=nightly.
#   MAX_PUSH_ATTEMPTS      bounded retry count (default 5)
#   PFB_SIGN_KEY           path to an ECDSA private key (PEM); when set and
#                        non-empty, passed to the publisher as --sign-key so the
#                        catalogue it (re)generates is signed (issue #2675).
#                        Unset or empty = unsigned, exactly today's behaviour.
#                        Because ECDSA signing is randomised, a target whose
#                        only reported changes are its catalogue archives
#                        (packagesite.pkg/data.pkg) — and whose archives, per
#                        scripts/catalogue_sig_only.py, differ from HEAD only in
#                        `.sig` members — is restored and dropped as a NOOP
#                        instead of publishing a re-signature of nothing.
# Optional — PUBLISH_STAGE=stage only, when GITHUB_ACTIONS-style outputs are
# wanted:
#   GITHUB_OUTPUT           when set and non-empty, this run appends
#                        staging_prefix=staging/<segment>,
#                        touched=<compact JSON array of "channel/varver">, and
#                        noop=true|false.
#

#   SOURCE_REPOSITORY, RELEASE_ID, RELEASE_TAG, SOURCE_SHA, DESTINATIONS
#                        the rest of the publish_release.py intake — see its --help
#   ASSETS_DIR             directory of downloaded .pkg assets + digests.json sidecar
#   HANDOFF_FILE           durable build-time tagged release handoff JSON; required
