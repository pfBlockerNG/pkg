# install.sh — put this pfSense box on a pfBlockerNG channel (issue #2416 follow-up:
# one script, --channel parameterizes it, replacing the earlier per-channel
# install-<ch>.sh + install-common.sh split).
#
# WHY ONE SCRIPT: repo bootstrap (conf + boot hook) and an installed package's
# channel move fold into ONE idempotent state machine, parameterized by --channel —
# a fresh box and an already-installed box converge through the same steps instead
# of separate scripts run in sequence, and re-running on a converged box mutates
# nothing (check-then-act throughout). Four near-identical per-channel wrapper
# scripts added nothing but drift risk over a single --channel argument.
#
# WHY EVERY pkg(8) CALL REDIRECTS STDIN FROM /dev/null: the published form is piped into
# `sh` (`fetch -qo - .../install.sh | sh -s -- --channel <ch>`), so the script's own
# stdin IS the script text — any child process that reads stdin without redirection
# would consume trailing script bytes and corrupt the run.
#
# Usage:
#   install.sh --channel <stable|testing|edge|nightly>   subscribe + install/converge
#   install.sh -h|--help                                  this text
#
# Published at https://${PFB_REPO_HOST}/install.sh; run ON the box:
#   fetch -qo - https://${PFB_REPO_HOST}/install.sh | sh -s -- --channel stable
#
# Env (all overridable; forks/staging/tests set these):
#   PKG_BIN           pkg(8) binary path (default: /usr/local/sbin/pkg)
#   PFBLOCKERNG_ROOT  filesystem root prefix (default: /)
#   PFB_BASE_URL      catalog base (default: http://<PFB_REPO_HOST>)
#   PFB_SSL_CA_CERT_PATH  CA hash dir exported to pkg (default: <root>/etc/ssl/certs)
#   PFB_SSL_CA_CERT_FILE  CA bundle exported to pkg (default: <root>/etc/ssl/cert.pem)
#                         Each half is guarded independently and exported on its own: the
#                         path when it is a directory, the bundle when it is a non-empty
#                         regular file. A box failing one guard still gets the other. Set
#                         either to "" to opt that half out.

# CA locations (issue #2514): on pfSense Plus, pfSense-repo-setup writes a PKG_ENV block
# into pkg.conf pinning SSL_CA_CERT_FILE to Netgate's private CA bundle, which carries
# only Netgate CAs. libpkg applies that block with setenv(..., overwrite=1), so a
# libfetch-based pkg (1.x) verifies against Netgate's CAs and nothing else, and every
# fetch from a third-party catalog fails with "certificate verify failed". PKG_ENV never
# sets SSL_CA_CERT_PATH, and libfetch loads file and path into one store
# (SSL_CTX_load_verify_locations(ctx, ca_cert_file, ca_cert_path)), so exporting the path
# survives the pin. That mirrors what a libcurl-based pkg (2.x) already does by default:
# peer verification stays fully enabled, the trust store is not modified, and no vendor
# configuration is touched.
#
# The bundle goes with it, because libfetch takes load_verify_locations() as soon as
# EITHER variable is set and then never calls SSL_CTX_set_default_verify_paths(). On a box
# with no pin (CE), exporting the path alone would therefore drop the default bundle from
# the store, and FreeBSD ships /etc/ssl/certs EMPTY until certctl rehash populates it — so
# path-only would turn a working stock box into this very failure. On Plus, PKG_ENV
# overwrites this value with Netgate's bundle, which is what should happen there.
#
# The bundle is checked with -f AND -s. load_verify_locations() reads the file eagerly and
# abandons the path when that read fails, so an empty or truncated bundle would take the
# whole store down with it, a state set_default_verify_paths() would have tolerated. -s
# alone is not enough because it is TRUE for a directory, whose size is nonzero.
#
# Setting either variable to the empty string opts that half out (hence `-`, not `:-`).
# Opting the BUNDLE out on a box with no PKG_ENV pin leaves the path-only store this code
# exists to avoid, so that half is for boxes whose bundle is known bad.

Installs the boot-time repo-conf generator hook (ADR-39), subscribes this box to the
named channel ALONE (retiring any other pfBlockerNG channel conf), then installs or
moves the running package onto pfSense-pkg-pfBlockerNG from that channel. Safe to
re-run: a converged box performs no package changes.

Exit codes:

  1  environment: pkg binary or hook source not found
  2  usage: unknown argument, unknown/missing --channel
  4  target unavailable: the hook could not resolve the conf, pkg update failed, the
     catalogue offers nothing, or pkg version -t gave no usable answer
  5  a pkg operation (delete/install) failed, including a package-script failure while pkg exited 0
