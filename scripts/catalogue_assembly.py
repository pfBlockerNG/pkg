"""Regenerate one channel/varver catalogue directly from the .pkg files already
sitting on disk: the tree itself IS the state.

Scope: no ledger, no git, no network, no scratch tree, no backup/rollback. The
retired design staged a whole multi-catalogue ``Plan`` into a scratch tree and
moved it into place with a recoverable per-target swap; that machinery existed
to protect a durable ledger this repo no longer has. Under this architecture the
release job itself IS the transaction: it drops verified ``.pkg`` assets straight into
``site_root/<channel>/<varver>/``, calls ``regenerate_catalogue`` to rebuild
that one directory from whatever is now present, and commits ``site_root`` to
``main`` — a failed run simply never reaches that commit, so there is nothing
here to roll back.

stdlib-only, Python 3.11. The engine (``pfb_pkg.py`` + ``build-repo-portable.py``)
is the already-built ``publish_catalogues.Engine`` handed in by the caller — this
module never loads it a second time. Emission (manifest reading, ABI/collision
checks, the catalog descriptor) is entirely the engine's ``build_repo``; this
module adds only directory-scoped staging (working around ``build_repo``'s own
``*.pkg`` glob re-picking up its own ``data.pkg``/``packagesite.pkg`` on a second
pass — see ``regenerate_catalogue``), retention, and the multi-destination
byte/checksum/provenance identity post-condition ``build_repo`` itself has no
reason to know about.

    ``None`` (the default) leaves the catalogue unsigned, byte-identical to

    The trap this function exists to dodge: ``build_repo`` globs ``*.pkg`` in its

    ``_CATALOG_PKG_FILES`` exclusion and staging ONLY that pool into a directory
    ``build_repo`` has never seen before is what makes regeneration idempotent.

    Writes directly into ``site_root`` (via ``build_repo``'s own
    ``catalog_name=f"{channel}/{varver}"`` routing) — no scratch tree, no backup,
    no rollback. ``build_repo``'s own ``_write_catalog_dir`` reads every staged
    source's bytes before wiping/rebuilding the destination, so a VALIDATION
    fault (a corrupt pool member, a mixed/concrete ABI, an unreadable archive)
    always raises before anything is deleted, leaving the directory untouched.

    That is not the only fault window, though: a write-back fault AFTER the
    wipe (mid-loop I/O error, disk full, process kill) can still leave the
    directory in a genuine third state — wiped and partially rebuilt, missing
    some of ``meta.conf``/``data.pkg``/``packagesite.pkg``/its ``.pkg`` files.
    This function does not contain that window by itself; it propagates
    whatever the engine raises, UNWRAPPED, exactly as for a validation fault.
    Containment is the CALLER's job: the caller must treat any exception from
