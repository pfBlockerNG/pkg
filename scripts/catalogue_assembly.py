"""Regenerate one channel/varver catalogue directly from the .pkg files already
sitting on disk (issue #2146 R1: "the tree IS the state").

Scope: no ledger, no git, no network, no scratch tree, no backup/rollback. The
retired design staged a whole multi-catalogue ``Plan`` into a scratch tree and
moved it into place with a recoverable per-target swap; that machinery existed
to protect a durable ledger this repo no longer has. Under the corrected
architecture (see the design doc landed alongside this change) the release
job itself IS the transaction: it drops verified ``.pkg`` assets straight into
``site_root/<channel>/<varver>/``, calls ``regenerate_catalogue`` to rebuild
that one directory from whatever is now present, and commits ``site_root`` to
``main`` — a failed run simply never reaches that commit, so there is nothing
here to roll back.

stdlib-only, Python 3.11. The engine (``pfb_pkg.py`` + ``build-repo-portable.py``)
is the already-built ``publish_catalogues.Engine`` handed in by the caller — this
module never loads it a second time. Emission (manifest reading, ABI/collision
checks, the catalog descriptor) is entirely the engine's ``build_repo``; this
module adds only directory-scoped staging (working around ``build_repo``'s own
``*.pkg`` glob re-picking up its own ``data.pkg``/``packagesite.pkg`` on a second
pass — see ``regenerate_catalogue``), retention, and the multi-destination
byte/checksum/provenance identity post-condition ``build_repo`` itself has no
reason to know about.
