"""Detect a signature-only delta between two catalogue archives (issue #2675).

ECDSA signing is randomised (OpenSSL implements no deterministic RFC 6979), so
signing an UNCHANGED catalogue payload with the SAME key still rewrites every
`.sig` member — see catalogue_engine.py's "Catalogue signing" comment
block. scripts/publish-pkg-repo.sh uses this module to tell that apart from a
real change before deciding whether a republish is a NOOP.

A delta is signature-only when the two zstd-tar archives (`packagesite.pkg` /
`data.pkg`, as written by catalogue_engine.py's `write_zstd_tar`) carry the
SAME member-NAME set, at least one member's name ends `.sig`, and every
member whose name does NOT end `.sig` is byte-identical. Comparing by member
name is equivalent to (and simpler than) inspecting `meta.conf`'s
signature_type: a `.pub` difference (key rotation) or any payload/member-set
change already fails one of those two conditions.

stdlib-only. Reuses pfb_pkg.zstd_decompress — never shells out to `tar`
(bsdtar and GNU tar diverge on zstd; see .agents/policy/testing.md).
