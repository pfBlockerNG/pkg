# ARCH-LESS FreeBSD `pkg` repository catalog WITHOUT libpkg, in pure Python
# (ADR-17): for a plain Linux CI runner with no real `pkg` binary, hand-rolling
# the same catalog `pkg repo` produces (meta.conf/packagesite.pkg/data.pkg,
# incl. the libpkg `sum` checksum — see pkg_checksum()) from each .pkg's
# manifest, deterministically and without network. Every pfBlockerNG .pkg is
# NO_ARCH (issue #1806): its manifest ABI is CPU-wildcarded (e.g.
# "FreeBSD:15:*"), so the catalog has no per-ABI subdirectory — one directory
# serves every arch of a FreeBSD major (see _is_wildcard_abi / build_repo).
# (scripts/build-repo.sh drives a real `pkg repo` and stays the FreeBSD/
# pfSense-side fallback; this is the CI/release builder.) FLAVOR-COLLISION
# GUARD, version-keyed catalogs (ADR-20), the matrix-driven build, and release

#
# Authenticity used to rest on HTTPS to the host, which is exactly what breaks
# on pfSense Plus: `pfSense-repo-setup` pins pkg to a Netgate-only CA bundle,
# and no environment-based workaround can reach the GUI (php-fpm scrubs the
# worker environment, and pfSense's own pkg_call() replaces it outright). A
# signed catalogue moves the trust anchor onto our own key, so the fetch itself
# no longer has to be TLS.
#
# Every byte below follows freebsd/pkg (13f9f98); the details are unforgiving
# because a mismatch fails only at verification, on the box:
#   * the signed message is the 64-character ASCII SHA256 HEX of the
#     UNCOMPRESSED catalogue member, signed ECDSA-SHA256 (`ecc_new()` pins
#     sig_hash = SHA256 for ecdsa regardless of curve). It is the CERT path —
#     `ecc_verify_cert_cb()` — that FINGERPRINTS mode runs, and it hashes with
#     PKG_HASH_TYPE_SHA256_HEX passed at `strlen()`, so no NUL terminator.
#     The BLAKE2b-512 chain in `ecc_sign_file()`/`ecc_verify_file()` belongs to
#     PUBKEY mode (single `signature` member) — signing that instead yields a
#     catalogue a real pkg rejects with "ecc signature verification failure".
#   * a non-RSA signature is prefixed `$PKGSIGN:<type>$` (PKGSIGN_HEAD,
#     libpkg/private/pkgsign.h), which is how the client selects the signer.
#   * the public half is DER for ECDSA (exported as PKCS#8 "for interoperability
#     with OpenSSL"); the ECC loader calls libder_read() and knows no PEM.
#   * the trusted fingerprint is the SHA256 of exactly those DER bytes, so any
#     re-encoding invalidates every fingerprint file already deployed.

    """Build the full variant repository tree from the version matrix.

    issue #1806: the catalog tree is ARCH-LESS — ``release/<varver>/`` and
    ``nightly/<varver>/`` hold the catalog directly (meta.conf, packagesite.pkg,
    data.pkg, the .pkg files), with NO per-arch subdirectory. All three
    pfSense-pkg-pfBlockerNG ports are NO_ARCH: a real package's manifest abi is
    CPU-wildcarded (``"FreeBSD:<major>:*"``, see ``_is_wildcard_abi``) — one
    varver directory serves every arch of that FreeBSD major, so there is
    nothing left to bucket by arch. ``_emit_catalog_from_paths`` hard-rejects a
    concrete-ABI package at emission (never a silent single-arch install).
    ``arch`` is retired from the matrix (issue #1806) — a row no longer carries
    it. This function still needs a literal CPU segment for the concrete
    ``--abi`` fed to the builder, per-row, so build-pkg-portable.py can derive
    the FreeBSD major: it defaults to ``"amd64"`` (a stray legacy ``arch`` key,
    if a row still carries one, is honored instead) — either way it no longer
    selects a catalog bucket.

    For each matrix entry (each carrying pfsense_version, variant, freebsd_major,
    php_version, py_flavor, optionally arch, and optionally role):

    **build entries** (``role`` absent or ``"build"`` — the default, unchanged path):

      * RELEASE subtree ``release/<varver>/`` — the testing and edge .pkgs, plus the stable
        .pkg built from ``stable_tag`` (skipped when no stable tag exists), optionally
        folded with pre-built older-release .pkg from ``release_extra_pkgs``, pruned to
        the ``release_keep_testing`` newest testing + ``release_keep_stable`` newest stable.
        Defaults (1/1) reproduce today's latest-only behaviour; setting higher values
        retains older artifacts in the catalog for diagnostics and reproducibility.
      * NIGHTLY subtree ``nightly/<varver>/`` — the freshly built nightly folded in
        with any pre-existing nightlies in that subtree (cache-restored by the caller),
        pruned to the ``nightly_keep`` newest. Skipped when ``build_nightly`` is False.
    **route-only entries** (``role == "route-only"`` — EOL versions served from frozen .pkg):

      * NO builder call for a fresh testing-HEAD .pkg — the version is EOL, no new build.
      * NO nightly subtree — a route-only entry never gets a nightly build.
      * RELEASE subtree ``release/<varver>/`` — built EXCLUSIVELY from the frozen
        .pkg supplied in ``route_only_pkgs[varver]`` (pre-downloaded Release assets
        provided by publish.yml — must be NO_ARCH/wildcard-ABI, same as every other
        catalog input; a concrete-ABI frozen .pkg is rejected at emission). The
        existing ``_emit_catalog_from_paths`` machinery handles the rest.
      * If ``route_only_pkgs`` has no entry for this ``varver`` (or is ``None``), the call
        raises ``BuildRepoError`` — a route-only entry with no frozen .pkg is a hard error.

    Frozen-.pkg input contract (``route_only_pkgs``):
      Callers (e.g. publish.yml) supply a ``dict[varver, list[Path]]`` mapping the
      ``catalog_name_from_version()`` key (e.g. ``"ce-2.7"``) to the ordered list of
      pre-downloaded .pkg files for that version. publish.yml downloads these from the
      corresponding GitHub Release tag and passes them here. Each path must be a valid,
      NO_ARCH .pkg (readable by ``read_compact_manifest``). The mapping is keyed by
      ``varver`` so multiple matrix rows of the same version share the same frozen .pkg
      pool (``_emit_catalog_from_paths`` deduplicates by (name, version)).

    ``release_pkgs`` (optional) — consume pre-built Release .pkg files instead of
      rebuilding testing/stable from source for build-entry matrix rows:
      ``dict[varver, list[Path]]`` mapping ``catalog_name_from_version()`` keys to lists
      of pre-built Release .pkg paths (e.g. all assets downloaded from GitHub Releases
      by publish.yml). When provided, the ``release/<varver>/`` catalog is SERVED
      from these (matched by OS+major via ``_pkg_matches_abi``, then pruned by
      ``retain_by_channel`` with ``release_keep_testing`` / ``release_keep_stable``)
      instead of calling the builder for testing/stable. ``release_extra_pkgs`` is
      still folded in after the pool.
      An empty pool for a varver skips that release catalog with a warning
      (no exception raised — a newly-added version with no Release asset yet simply has
      no release-channel package until the next release covers it; nightly still covers
      it from HEAD). Nightly is unaffected — the nightly subtree is always built from
      source when ``build_nightly`` is True, regardless of ``release_pkgs``.
      When ``None`` (the default), the existing build-from-source path is used unchanged.

    ``dep_pkgs`` (optional, issue #1806 / #2403) — pre-built dependency .pkg files
      (e.g. py311-charset-normalizer, built by build-dep-pkg-portable.py) folded
      into BOTH the release AND nightly catalogs of every build-role matrix entry
      whose ABI matches (OS+major; see ``_pkg_matches_abi`` — a NO_ARCH dep's abi
      is CPU-wildcarded) AND whose ``extra_pkgs`` declares the dep's origin (same
      ``_row_declares_origin`` rule as ``publish_release`` / ``publish_nightly`` —
      same-major ABI is not enough). Folded AFTER retention
      (``retain_by_channel`` / ``_retain_newest``) — NEVER before, or a dep would
      compete with real releases/nightlies for a retention slot. Route-only
      (frozen EOL) entries never receive a dep pkg. A dep pkg that ABI-matches
      and is declared by no catalog it actually landed in is a hard
      ``BuildRepoError`` (fail loud, never a silent drop) — matched is tracked only
      at the point a dep is folded into an EMITTED catalog, never merely because its
      ABI matched a row (issue #1806 gate-A finding: a matched-but-unemitted dep must
      still raise).

    ``builder`` is injectable (tests pass a stub); the default drives build-pkg-portable.py.
    Default builds require one validated normalized record per emitted channel route; pass
    those paths through ``build_records``. Extra ``builder_kwargs`` pass through to every
    builder call. Returns a summary dict.
