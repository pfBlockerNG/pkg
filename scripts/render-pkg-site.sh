# render-pkg-site.sh — renders the pkg website (everything under pfBlockerNG/pkg's
# docs/ EXCEPT the catalogue-owned trees) from this repo's pkg-site/ via
# gen_landing.py, then commits and pushes a standalone site-source render.
# Publication promotion and Nightly use publish-pkg-repo.sh's integrated renderer
# so catalogue and site land atomically; this entry point handles site-only changes.
#
# GUARD: a render commit may never touch a catalogue-owned path (CATALOGUE_DIRS,
# which MUST equal gen_landing.py's own constant of the same name) — enforced by
# a name-only diff right after staging, before any commit. A violation resets the
# index and exits 1, no exceptions (gen_landing.py's own sync_site() already
# refuses to write one; this is the shell-side backstop).
#
# On a rejected push, the ENTIRE cycle re-syncs + re-renders from a fresh
# origin/main checkout (never a rebase of the local commit) — same rationale as
# publish-pkg-repo.sh's own retry loop: the renderer must see the racing run's
# tree, not stale local state.
#
# Required environment:
#   PFB_SRC          current pkg checkout containing gen_landing.py and pkg-site/
#   PKG_REPO         same pkg checkout with a credentialed origin remote
#   BASE_URL         Pages base URL passed to gen_landing.py
#   SOURCE_RUN_ID    provenance trailer on the render commit
#   ROUTE_MATRIX     the pinned ROUTE matrix, compact JSON array text (same shape
#                    the publisher receives) — transformed into gen_landing.py's
#                    --matrix input below
# Optional:
#   MAX_PUSH_ATTEMPTS  bounded retry count (default 5)
